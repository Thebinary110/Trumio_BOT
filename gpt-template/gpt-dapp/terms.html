                  Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire
                  liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any
                  provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of
                  the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by

                  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event
                  shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special,
                  incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever
                  (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits,
                  loss of data or other information, for business interruption,

                  Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised
                  of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
                  fails of its essential purpose.

                  Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties
                  or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential
                  damages, which means that some of the above limitations may
                  not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be
                  limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
